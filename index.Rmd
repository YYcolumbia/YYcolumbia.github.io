My name is Yang Yi, and I was born in China. Here's a picture of myself.

I've graduated from University of Washington with Bachelor's Degree in Psychology. And currently I'm a graduate student studying [Biostatistics](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/biostatistics) at Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University.

This is my shiny little dog _Brownie_, he is adorable isn't he?
